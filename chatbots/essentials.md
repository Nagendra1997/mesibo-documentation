Mesibo chatbot & scripting platform allows you to harness the power of Javascript for each message your users are sending and receiving. You can create a JavaScript that can carry out your own decision logic on each message to create interesting chatbots and apps.

Below are two easy to follow examples before we drive deeper into the mesibo chatbot and scripting platform.

Isn't it easy and powerful? This creates unlimited creative possibilities for building with Mesibo. You can build chatbots, filters, translators, implement socket, and database logic, all from the comfort and ease of Javascript. Note that chatbot and scripting platform can not work with mesibo end-to-end encryption.

The best part is that mesibo chatbot and scripting platform is available at no additional cost; you can download the entire platform on your own servers and use it at no extra cost. Hence, there are no reasons for you to use any other platform that charges per conversation or charges per bot, in our opinion, those kind of charges are simply exorbitant and unreasonable to developers.  Mesibo is built by developers for developers and we tried to address many of the limitations existing platforms have, both technical and otherwise. 

mesibo scripting is built on V8 - [Googleâ€™s open-source, high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine](https://v8.dev), written in C++, used by chrome and node.js, and offers blazing fast performance. It enables you to write chatbots in javascript, a familiar 
territory instead of learning new technology or fiddling with those XML and inadequate UIs some other platforms uses.

Now let's get started on the platform itself.

Mesibo Scripting offers you variety of functionality that help you interface with the core features of Mesibo over an easy to use Javascript interface.

You can also use the scripting module on your own premise/servers if you are [hosting Mesibo](https://mesibo.com/documentation/on-premise/). You can load the scripting module and configure it to run your script.

## Basic Concepts
You can specify your customised logic for each event such as when you receive a message, when a user logs in,etc and also use core utility functions provided by mesibo to perform different actions like sending a message, making an HTTP request, connecting to a socket, writing to a database, etc.

The scripting interface is provided through the Mesibo Cloud console and you need not configure or install anything additional to use it. Just login to your application console , load your script and get going! 

With Mesibo Scripting you can specify your customized logic for each event such as when a user  sends or recieves a message,  when auser logs in,etc and also use core utility functions provided by mesibo to perform different actions like sending a message, makingan HTTP request, connecting to a socket, write to a database, etc. You can build chatbots, filter messages, modify or translate messages and much more to open up unlimited creative possibilities all from the comfort and ease of Javascript.

You can configure a scripts that will be triggered when a user sends data or receives  data. You can also configure a default app script that runs for all events at the app level.

If you are using Mesibo On-Premise you can use the Scripting Module and configure the same.The module interface is provided in native C/C++ platform which ensures raw performance and stability.

## How Mesibo Scripting Works
mesibo makes it extremely simple to make chatbots or your scripting apps.

 1. Write a javascript with functions performing your custom logic for each event, such as when you receive a message, or message status, when a user logs in, etc.

 2. Upload script in the mesibo console and specify when this script should be invoked. You can invoke script for all the messages for all the users, or for a particular user. You can also specify the direction (from and to) of the message.

 3. That's it, mesibo will invoke your script as requested. Your script can analyze the message and decide on the action to perform, for example, respond, moderate, translate, modify, drop, or pass as it is.

You can use the same script for multiple users or different scripts for different users.You can even use the different scripts for the same users in each message direction.

The scripting interface is provided through the Mesibo Cloud console, and you need not configure or install anything additional to use it. Just login to your mesibo console, load your script, and get going!

## Pricing of the Scripting Platform

Mesibo offers a Pay-as-you-GO pricing model. If you are using Mesibo Scripting on the cloud, you will be charged for running your script on a per-second basis. ie; If your script is active for 10 seconds, then your charge willbe $XX/second * 10 seconds = $YY. 

However, if you are using Mesibo Scripting on your own server by loading the [scripting module]() there are no charges whatsoever.

Please not that all other charges for using Mesibo APIs and services are independent and remain the same.
For more details refer [Mesibo Pricing](https://mesibo.com/pricing/)

## Examples for using Mesibo Scripting

Here is a glimpse of what you can do with Mesibo Scripting. This code snippet sends a custom reply to any message recieved. 
## Sending an automatic response 

```javascript
mesibo.onmessage = function(message){
	//On receiving a message we send an automated reply to the sender 

	//Create a new Message object
	var replyMessage = new Message();

	//Custom response text/data	
	replyMessage.data = "This is an automated response";

	//Send Message!	
	replyMessage.send();
}
```

The further sections of this document will explain the usage of using various classes you can use in your script,their properties and methods in detail.

- [Mesibo]()
- [Messaging]()
- [Http]()
- [Socket]()

# Mesibo  
The core class `Mesibo` defines a set of callbacks and utilities that you can use to send messages, get message flags, receive messages, etc.  

# Constructor
The class `Mesibo` is not instantiable. A single instance of the class `Mesibo`, named `mesibo` exists in global context whose properties can be initialized. Refer [Usage Notes]() for more details.

# Properties

## `Mesibo.onmessage` <sub>mandatory</sub>  
An event listener to be called when message is receieved. It is mandatory to initialize this event handler.
MUST return Message.PASS, Message.FAIL, Message.CONSUMED, Message.READ, Message.DELIVERED etc, or the message string. 

### Syntax

```javscript
mesibo.onmessage = callback;
```
### Values
- callback is the function to be executed when a message is received. The parameter to this callback function is an object of type [`Message`]()

### Example
```javascript
mesibo.onmessage = function(m){
	var messageText = m.message; 
	print("Got a message from"  + message.peer + " id: " + message.id + " msg: " + messageText);
	return Mesibo.CONSUMED;
}
```

## `Mesibo.onmessagestatus` <sub>optional</sub>  
An event listener to be called when status of the message is recieved. Note that the status for a message will be received only when you set the corresponding flag in the message parameters while sending the message. Initialization of this handler is optional.

### Global Session Properties
Session properties exist as a single instance at the global level. Please note that any changes made to the session properties will affect all references to the session object. The following session properties are accessible from all other classes and all of them refer to the singular session instance.

## Mesibo.session_id <sub>read-only</sub>
Session value generted by mesibo. This number describes a session and stays constant throughout the lifetime of the script.
If this value is null, it is a bad session.

## Mesibo.session
Session Object. Properties of this object can be modified to reflect at global level.


The poperties above are accessible from all class objects.
Example, `Mesibo.session`, `Message.session`, `Http.session`, `Socket.session`, `Dialogflow.session`, etc.

# Usage notes

## Instantiation restriction
The class `Mesibo` is not instantiable. 

ie; The following operation is invalid  

```javscript
var m = new Mesibo()
```

Only a single global instance of `Mesibo` class , defined as `mesibo` exists throughout the lifetime of your script. 

## Global Initialization  
It is *necessary* to initialize the event handlers for the global `mesibo` object before you use any other class or function in your script. The handler `mesibo.onmessage` needs to be initialized compulsorily in your script. `mesibo.onlogin` and `mesibo.onmessagestatus` are optional handlers that can be defined if required.
